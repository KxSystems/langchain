      "Rights of Man:\n",
      "1. Men are born and remain free and equal in rights. Social distinctions can only be based on common utility.\n",
      "2. The purpose of political association is the preservation of the natural and imprescriptible rights of man, which are liberty, property, security, and resistance to oppression.\n",
      "3. The principle of sovereignty resides essentially in the nation. No body or individual can exercise any authority that does not emanate expressly from the nation.\n",
      "4. Liberty consists of being able to do anything that does not harm others. The exercise of the natural rights of each man has no limits other than those that ensure the enjoyment of these same rights by other members of society. These limits can only be determined by law.\n",
      "5. The law has the right to prohibit only actions harmful to society. Anything not prohibited by law cannot be prevented, and no one can be compelled to do what it does not command.\n",
      "6. The law is the expression of the general will. All citizens have the right to personally participate, or through their representatives, in its formation. It must be the same for all, whether it protects or punishes. All citizens, being equal in its eyes, are equally eligible to all public dignities, positions, and employment, according to their abilities, and without any other distinction than that of their virtues and talents.\n",
      "7. No man can be accused, arrested, or detained except in cases determined by law and according to the forms it has prescribed. Those who solicit, expedite, execute, or cause to be executed arbitrary orders must be punished. But any citizen called or seized in virtue of the law must obey instantly; he makes himself guilty by resistance.\n",
      "8. The law should establish only strictly and obviously necessary penalties, and no one can be punished except in virtue of a law established and promulgated prior to the offense, and legally applied.\n",
      "9. Every man is presumed innocent until declared guilty. If it is deemed necessary to arrest him, any severity that is not necessary to ensure his person must be severely punished by law.\n",
      "10. No one should be disturbed for his opinions, even religious ones, provided that their manifestation does not disturb the established public order.\n",
      "11. The free communication of thoughts and opinions is one of the most precious rights of man. Every citizen can therefore speak, write, and print freely, except to answer for the abuse of this freedom in cases determined by law.\n",
      "12. The guarantee of the rights of man and of the citizen requires a public force. This force is therefore instituted for the advantage of all and not for the particular utility of those to whom it is entrusted.\n",
      "13. For the maintenance of the public force and for the expenses of administration, a common contribution is necessary. It must be equally distributed among all citizens, according to their abilities.\n",
      "14. All citizens have the right to ascertain, by themselves or through their representatives, the necessity of the public contribution, to consent to it freely, to follow its use, and to determine its amount, basis, collection, and duration.\n",
      "15. Society has the right to demand accountability from any public agent for his administration.\n",
      "16. Any society in which the guarantee of rights is not assured, nor the separation of powers determined, has no constitution.\n",
